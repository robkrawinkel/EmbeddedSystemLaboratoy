As discussed in the report, on the final setup where everything was combined the PID controller no longer worked.
The code that was used for the final demonstrator without the PID controller (and with a simple proportional controller) can be found in the Object_tracking_demo folder.
As the individual code that was used to test the PID controller on the NIOS II did work, we also included that in the PID_motor_controller_demo folder
